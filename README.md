![Battlesnake Logo](https://docs.battlesnake.com/img/logo-light.svg)

## Technologies Used

This project uses [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/). It also comes with an optional [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) to help with deployment.

## Run Your Battlesnake

Install dependencies using pip

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start your Battlesnake

```sh
python main.py
```

You should see the following output once it is running

```sh
Running your Battlesnake at http://0.0.0.0:8000
 * Serving Flask app 'My Battlesnake'
 * Debug mode: off
```

Open [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser and you should see

```json

```

* You can [download compiled binaries here](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/rules/releases)
* or [install as a go package](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/rules/tree/main/cli#installation) (requires Go 1.18 or higher)

Command to run a local game

```

## Next Steps

**Note:** To play games on [play.battlesnake.com](https://play.battlesnake.com) you'll need to deploy your Battlesnake to a live web server OR use a port forwarding tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to access your server locally.
